# Maximum-Capacity-Sensor
Goal: automatically detect how many people enter and exit Trader Joeâ€™s, and alert customers when to enter or exit
based upon a set maximum number of customers using an Arduino.

The code is designed for a set up with two ultrasonic sensors and one 20x4 LCD Display Module. The set-up and code
are designed to count the number of people who "enter" or "exit" Trader Joe's, with one sensor detecting people
entering, the other people exiting.

The Final_Counter file can be uploaded to the arduino set up to print the number of people entering and exiting the
store and whether customers may enter or exit based upon the maximum capacity.

You may selectively comment or uncomment code to match desired output.
